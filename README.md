# Arpan's Interactive Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio website! This project combines a retro-style command-line interface with modern 3D web technologies to create a unique and engaging user experience.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and background through a simulated terminal environment. It features a split-screen layout on desktop interfaces, pairing the terminal with a physics-enabled 3D ID card.

## Features

-   **Interactive Terminal**: A fully functional command-line interface (CLI) that accepts various commands to navigate the portfolio.
-   **3D Physics Integration**: A realistic, interactive 3D ID card built with **Three.js** and **React Three Rapier**. You can drag, swing, and interact with the card using your mouse.
-   **Responsive Design**:
    -   **Desktop**: Resizable split-pane view featuring both the 3D card and the terminal.
    -   **Mobile**: Optimized full-screen terminal experience.
-   **Custom Shell Experience**: Simulates a real terminal environment with command history, tab completion, and typing effects.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

-   **React** (v19)
-   **Vite** - For fast development and building.
-   **Tailwind CSS** - For utility-first styling.
-   **Three.js** & **React Three Fiber** - For 3D graphics.
-   **React Three Rapier** - For 3D physics simulation.
-   **@react-three/drei** - For useful helpers and abstractions.
